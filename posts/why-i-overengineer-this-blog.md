For every hour I spend on writing I spend 6 overengineering [alexnault.dev](https://alexnault.dev/).

Truth is, this blog could very well be built with a few static HTML pages and it would still bring the same value to readers.

But getting thoughts out there and spreading knowlege isnt the only goals of this site.

<!-- But this misses another very important aspect of this blog. It is a learning playground for tehc.

But i would be missing a great learning opportunity. In fact, this blog is a learning playground -->

> This website is a chance for playing around whit ideas, technologies and patterns.

"Leaning by doing" is my goto strategy for proper knowledge retention. And i chose this website as a playground for it.

<!-- The reason is simple: it's a great learning opportinity. -->

<!-- I chose this website/blog as a learning playground, free of constraints. -->

While I am tahnkful to my employer for cultivaing an environement that promotes learning and quality work, this blog allows me to learn at more relaxed pace and without contraint.

Theres is this myriad of new tool available to us everyday as developers and, for someone like me that loves trying new stuff, this is all very exciting!

So while I like writing, I like coding more.

<!-- On top of it, I am having a ton of fun doing it! -->

And right now, I am holding myself back from coding so that I can finally write this post.

<!-- As I am writing, I'm realizing this is time I could be spending on learning Prisma which I am currently iintegrating. -->

So anyway, stay curious and keep learning!
